Notebooks should be able to run from start to finish. 
`pd.to_pickle` checkpoints were made througout the EDA notebook where .pkl files were created. 
These have been commented out and replaced with an equivalent `pd.read_pickle` to read in the checkpoint data.

## Notebooks:
- 1_EDA.ipynb
- 2_Linear_Regression.ipynb
- 3_SARIMA.ipynb
- 4_Exponential_Smoothing.ipynb
- 5_Prophet.ipynb

## Other Files:
- Final Report.pdf
- Final Presentation.pptx
- timeseries.yaml

## Data Folder:
- Data Source.url
- DF_dict.pkl
- LCL_unstack.pkl
- LCL_unstack_hrs.pkl
- LCL_unstack_day.pkl
- LCL_unstack_wks.pkl

Raw data was too large to upload to GitHub. This can be downloaded in .pkl format from:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IO0Uw8hRwSkFH3EUPYjePXoc0fGohZ6k?usp=sharing

The entire `raw` folder should be downloaded and placed in teh `data` folder.

Alternatively from the 'Data Source.url' shortcut.
